# My first Python code 


### 1. Your first code

a. Print the following statements using multiple ```print()``` statements 
```
All the world's a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players: 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
```

b. Print the above statements using a single ```print()``` statement

c. Without coding, what is the output of the following statement:
```print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")```

d. Identify a situation where you have to print data with ```flush=True``` and ```flush=False```.

e. By default, the ```flush``` is disabled but ```print()``` output behaves like ```flush=True```. Which argument triggers the flush?
