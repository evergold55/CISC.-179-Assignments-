# My first Python code 


### 1. Your first code

a. Print the following statements using multiple ```print()``` statements 

```python
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```

b. Print the above statements using a single ```print()``` statement

```python
print("All the world's a stage,\nAnd all the men and women merely players:\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,\nHis acts being seven ages.")
```



c. Without coding, what is the output of the following statement:
```print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")```

127.0.0.1

d. Identify a situation where you have to print data with ```flush=True``` and ```flush=False```.

You'd want to use flush=True if you want to count to a certain number every second without the entire result showing up at the same time.
You'd want to use flush=False if you wanted to see the entire output immediately.  

e. By default, the ```flush``` is disabled but ```print()``` output behaves like ```flush=True```. Which argument triggers the flush?
 
 The argument "end" 

## Challenges

Please describe the challenges you faced during the exercise.

```python
# I knew I had to use '\n' in order to print the statement using print once, but also get the result in multiple lines,
 but wasn't sure where to put it
